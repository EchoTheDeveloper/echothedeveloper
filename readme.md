# Hi! I am EchoTheDeveloper, In code I might mark myself as NotEchoDev and I own a small indie dev studio of 4 people called Vortex Studios.

# Right now I am making [The Isle Goblin Mod Maker](https://github.com/EchoTheDeveloper/isle-goblin-mod-maker) and a [Code Editor called Vortexlang Editor](https://github.com/EchoTheDeveloper/vortexlang_editor). The code editor is actually for my game engine, to edit vortexlang, my scripting language on my game engine. In total I have 4 current main/big projects and 2 are open source, 1 is in beta, 1 is publishes, 2 are not publishes yet with 1 of those being planned to be open source upon entering beta, and the other staying private.
